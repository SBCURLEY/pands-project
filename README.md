The iris data consisted of 150 samples of three species of Iris. The first column represented sepal length, the second column represented sepal width, the third column represented petal length, and the fourth column represented petal width.  I'm going to use ______  to classify these instances according to their species of Iris, which will be distinguished based on their measurements. The picture of the Iris species is given below:

The these iris species look similar, but the difference in measurements can be used to classify them. The input variables are sepal length and width and petal length and width; each row represents an instance or observation. The output variable is Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica; each column represents a class label.
